## Semantics applied to the file

The original file was using several <div>'s and Classes, making it difficult to identify the sections of the website in the code.

Semantics was applied to the HTML file adding elements such as:
## Header 
for the company name and a short description of the services.
## Nav
for the internal links that help to navigate in the site
## Aside 
for the value propossition to the customer 
## Section 
for the services provided by the company
## Footer
For company information

The CSS file use too much classes most of them identical to similar sections of the site.

After refining the HTML file, the CSS was refined as well, grouping the styles applied to each section, reducing significantly the number of code lines but specially giving the same structure than the semantics in HTML to mae it easy to understand.

additional styles applied to the CSS file are among:
## float
## Hover
## text-shadow
## min-height
## max-height
## overflow
## clear

After the changes and solving several miss adjustments the web site looks funtional again and the code is more clear and structured.
